\section2. Discretization of convection{diffusion
Derive a proper variational formulation of the convection{di usion prob-
lem.  Derive sucient conditions that make the problem well-posed.  Discuss
why oscillations appear for standard Galerkin methods and show how SUPG
methods resolve these problems.  Discuss also approximation properties in
light of Cea's lemma.
