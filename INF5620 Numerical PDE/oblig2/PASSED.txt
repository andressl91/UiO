Some problems running the code, the plotting section is bugged
Convergence rates aren't the ones that are expected due to an error in the creation of the x mesh. 
  It would probably run well if you fix that.
Very well formatted output
The code is well written and understandable
The report is super detailed

GOOD JOB!
