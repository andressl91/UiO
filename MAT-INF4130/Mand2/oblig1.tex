We are presented the general problem \\
\textit{Find a k-dimensional subspace W of R m so that the sum of the (squared) distances from a set of n given points x1,x2,. . . ,xn in R m to W is as small as possible}
We define the \textit{matrix of observations} \textbf{X} as \\

\begin{align*}
	\text{\textbf{X}} = 
 \begin{pmatrix}
  x_{1}^{(1)} & x_{2}^{(1)} & \cdots & x_{n}^{(1)} \\
  x_{1}^{(2)} & x_{2}^{(2)} & \cdots & x_{n}^{(2)} \\
  \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
  x_{1}^{(m)} & x_{2}^{(m)} & \cdots & x_{n}^{(m)}
 \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}

\section{Problem 1}
First we assume that W is known such that $\{w_i\}_{i=1}^{k}$ is an orthonormal basis for W, and let $\{w_i\}_{i=k+1}^{m}$
be an orthonormal basis for $W^{\perp}$. We define the projection operator 
$proj_u v = \frac{\langle v , u\rangle}{\langle u, u \rangle}$ as the projection of a vector v onto the vector u. \\
Now using this operator to find the projection of the columns of the matrix of observations $x_i$ on the space $W^\perp$ we get 

\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=1}^n	
\end{align*}
